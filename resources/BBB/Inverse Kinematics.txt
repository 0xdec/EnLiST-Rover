First step: bound the velocity and angular velocity to a circular domain

	if sqrt(v^2 + ω^2) > 1, v = v/sqrt(v^2 + ω^2) and ω = ω/sqrt(v^2 + ω^2)

Second step: calculate the velocity for each motor
x is the horizontal distance from the center of the rover to the given motor (left is negative, right is positive)
y is the vertical distance from the center of the rover to the given motor

	v_out = sqrt((v/ω - x)^2 + y^2) / ω

Third step: map v and ω to their real ranges

	v gets mapped from [-1, 1] to [-v_max, v_max] (replace v_max with actual max velocity, found from diameter and speed of wheel)
	ω gets mapped from [-1, 1] to [-ω_max, ω_max] (TBD)
